# Bouncing-Box
## Task
The problem is to make the provided box move diagonally, bounce at the edges and continue moving in the opposite direction till it touches the edge again.


## Description
I initialized a variable mybox to my bouncing box id. Then i created a function bouncing box and defined the properties to make it move without passing the (0,0) coordinate

## Installation
I installed my project using docode. Running the code on docode, it works perfectly although I feel it is a little fast.
 

## Usage
The code works by moving the box diagonallyat a speed of 4. When the box gets to extreme end of the container either left, right, top o9r down, it changes direction to the opposite direction and continues. - How does it work?
